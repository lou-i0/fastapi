# fastapi

## Introduction
This Repository has been created to document and apply my knowledge of using FASTAPI. 

## What is FastAPI
FastAPI from my understanding provides a web interface via an API (Application Programmable Interface) to provide access to what you have created for end users. Can imagine this could be useful for providing a database to read from/ write to, display Machine models you have created to end users to provide predictions based on new data provided and more! 

## What I intend to do with this repo?
I plan on providing a couple of examples in the hopes it helps someone (and myself!) inj the future:
1. Bare bones simple example
2. Example using a Machine learning Dataset and model (simple exaple like Iris dataset etc)
3. More custom Example using my own Machine Learning Model and dataset curated.
4.

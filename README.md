# fastapi

## Introduction
This Repository has been created to document and apply my knowledge of using FASTAPI. 

## What is FastAPI
FastAPI from my understanding provides a web interface via an API (Application Programmable Interface) to provide access to what you have created for end users. Can imagine this could be useful for providing a database to read from/ write to, display Machine models you have created to end users to provide predictions based on new data provided and more! 

## What I intend to do with this repo?
I plan on providing a couple of examples in the hopes it helps someone (and myself!) inj the future:
1. Bare bones simple example with different pages [Simple Example](main_simple.py)
2. An example to provide results from a DuckDB Query as an output [duckdb Example](main_duckdb.py)
3. Example using a Machine learning Dataset and model (simple example like titanic dataset) [First stage- build the model(s)](main_ml1.ipynb) and [Second Stage - show prediction on API](main_ml2.py)
4. Host the API via a front end like Streamlit ? (Not started)
5. Find a way to containerise a solutions via a virtual environment and Docker. (Not started)
